# Unified XUL Platform (UXP)

This repository holds the code for a unified application platform for XUL-based
applications. It is a hard fork from the Mozilla code repository (mozilla-central)
with an ESR-52 fork point.

In addition to further development based on the Mozilla upstream code, and
selective cherry-picking of directly-applicable patches, this repository has its
own development and holds the base for a maintained platform to be used by XUL
applications.

For a list of active projects making use of the Unified XUL Platform, checkout http://thereisonlyxul.org/.
