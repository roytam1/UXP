# Unified XUL Platform (UXP)

This repository holds the code for a unified application platform for XUL-based
applications. It is a hard fork from the Mozilla code repository (mozilla-central)
with an ESR-52 fork point.

In addition to further development based on the Mozilla upstream code, and
selective cherry-picking of directly-applicable patches, this repository has its
own development and holds the base for a future platform to be used by XUL
applications.

This repository will contain at least one application to demonstrate and make use
of the platform: The Basilisk web browser, a close twin to Mozilla's Firefox.

## Additional documentation

Additional documentation relevant to this source code can be found in the `/docs`
directory. This will contain relevant documentation regarding contributing,
using and distributing this code and its binaries.

If you are interested in the development and building side of things, some
information will be available on the [Pale Moon developer wiki](http://developer.palemoon.org).
